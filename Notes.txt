***************** H2 database *************
****************                **********

H2 Database is a lightweight, fast, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) written in Java.

It is often used in Java applications (like Spring Boot projects) for development, testing, and sometimes even in production for lightweight use cases.

Key Features of H2 Database:

Written in Java â€“ runs anywhere Java runs.

Lightweight & Fast â€“ small size (~2 MB JAR) and quick startup.

Modes of Operation:

Embedded Mode â€“ database runs inside the same JVM as the application.
ðŸ‘‰ Common for development/testing (no separate DB server needed).

Server Mode â€“ can run as a standalone database server and allow multiple clients to connect.

In-Memory Mode â€“ data is stored only in RAM (gets lost when the app stops).

SQL Support â€“ supports standard SQL and many features of larger databases.

Browser Console â€“ comes with a web-based console for running SQL queries.

Integration â€“ works smoothly with frameworks like Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, JPA.
